nsplist

    nsplist is a package that provides a parser for the NextStep plist
    text-based format. A common usage is parsing iTunes In App Purchase
    receipts to be able to reject them early, without having to make a
    request to the iTunes API.

    This is distinct from the Apple plist format, which has more
    supported types and serialises to XML or binary.


Examples:

    >>> import nsplist
    >>> print nsplist.loads('{"x" = "1"; "y" = "2";}')
    {u'x': u'1', u'y': u'2'}
